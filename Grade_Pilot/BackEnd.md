## $\color{GreenYellow}{\textsf{COLOR SCHEMES:}}$
- All Formulas are embedded into their corresponding colored Cell
- Grey Colors are Manually Manipulated on **[FrontEnd](https://github.com/Kyros0718/EXCEL_Project/edit/main/Grade_Pilot/FrontEnd.md)**

## $\color{GreenYellow}{\textsf{FORMULAS:}}$

## GradeBook Range _(Semi-Automatic Setup Required)_
> ⚠️ You must manually scale the range to cover all Assignment's: Task, Scores, and Points
> 
> 🧩 This step is required to define the boundary for dynamic calculations
> 
> ✅ Designed to be easy to resize—just drag to include all rows
>

## Automatic Required Average Percentage per Generated Category
> Shows how much % each category must contribute to reach "Desired Grade"
>

## Automatic Category Recognition & Generation
>⚠️ Naming Consistency required — make sure the first word in each assignment name matches the category exactly (e.g., HW 1, HW 2, etc.)
>
>🧩 Detects the first word of each assignment to generate its corresponding category

## Automatic Reverse Grade Calculator
> Enter a target letter grade
> 
> Calculates required scores on future assignments to meet that grade
